$ roslaunch so3_quadrotor_simulator heli_simulator.launch
#Term 2
$ cd swarm_gcs
$ electron .
```
GUI: https://github.com/HkUST-Swarm/swarm_gcs. 
A RC transmitter with USB is essential as input device. Recommend those with OpenTX (Radiomaster TX16s, Frsky X9D) or Futaba 16iz. 
If you choose using xbox-like controller, it's hard to control thrust in the sim.
